            <p class="books__description-text">More and more, designers are
              grappling with product management—as
              a peer discipline, as the job title of a boss or teammate, and as
              a future career destination.</p>
            <p class="books__description-text">But there is surprisingly little
              help for designers who seek to
              understand what it takes to manage products and services.</p>
            <p class="books__description-text">In <i>Product Management for UX
              People: From Designing to Thriving in a Product World</i>, Christian Crumlish plumbs
              the intersections and gaps between design and product management
              for both designers who want to work with product managers and
              designers who want to become product managers.</p>

              you grow them from engineers? Designers? Project Managers?</p>
            <p class="books__description-text">It turns out that you can.
              Product managers, product designers,
              product developers can all grow and enhance their capabilities and
              capacity to work together productively by deepening their
              understanding of the full spectrum of the product mindset. And
              when you do that, you start building a product culture, one person
              at a time. </p>
            <p class="books__description-text">In this book, Christian Crumlish
              describes the expertise, skills,
              and frameworks that come together in every great product
              person—and shows you how you can put these ideas to work inside
              your organization.</p>

              entrepreneurs today must grapple with
              creating social interfaces to foster user interaction and
              community, but grasping the nuances and the building blocks of the
              digital social experience is much harder than it appears. Now you
              have help.</p>
            <p class="books__description-text">In the 2nd edition of this
              practical guide, you’ll learn from our

              components to an existing site, encouraging users to interact with
              eachother, using a rating system to build a social experience
              around products or services, exploring numerous examples of each

            <p class="books__description-text">The development of social
              networks on the Web touches countless
              aspects of our everyday lives. With instant access to people of
              similar mindsets, we can readily form partnerships with more
              people and in more ways than ever before.</p>
            <p class="books__description-text">Through a series of pertinent
              case studies and interviews with
              leading thinkers and doers in this rapidly evolving field,
              Christian Crumlish uncovers universal themes and lessons learned.
              He illustrates how we use peer-to-peer technologies--web services,
              blogs, mobile phone SMS, and more—to accomplish widespread goals.
              He also suggests how we can take even more advantage of these
              technologies to connect with people who have similar interests.</p>
            <p class="books__description-text">Discover how Howard Dean's
              campaign used the Internet to take a
              little-known candidate a long way. How activists arrange public
              meetings and drive letter-writing campaigns. How individuals find
              much-needed help for personal issues. How artists promote and air
              their creative genius. How business people and singles seek
              potential partners. And much, much more.</p>
