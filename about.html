          <p class="about__subtitle">OptiListen helps you get better at listening. Quickly set goals and track how much time you’re speaking on video and audio calls. Unlock the listener within.</p>

        <a name="who"></a><h1 class="h1">About us</h1>
          <p>Long Sky Media publishes books, makes apps, and tries to bring a wee bit of trout music to the world. OptiListen was created by Dan Brodnitz and Christian Crumlish, who also fancy themselves its first customers. The app was designed by Elaine Phong and developed by Fractal Labs. The website was designed by Josh Eisenstat. Rebecca Baror provided design direction.</p>

        <a name="questions"></a><h1 class="h1">Questions you may have</h1>
      
          <dl><dt>Q: Why did you all make this app?</dt>
<dd>A: We were working on our own listening skills, and realized that talk <time, pause> talk <time, pause> was going to break our spirits, so we created a hands-free app that could let us focus less on the buttons and more on trying to be a little more present for the people on our audio and video calls.</dd>

  <dt>Q: Do I need to wear headphones for the app to work?</dt>
<dd>A: Yes -- that way the app hears that you are talking but not the other folks on the call.</dd>

<dt>Q: Does the app collect any personal data?</dt>
<dd>A: It doesn't -- no login, no data. All data is kept on your phone.</dd>

<dt>Q: Are you all better listeners now?</dt>
<dd>A: Better, hopefully. But it's a journey! :-) Be hear now, good people!</dd>

        <a name="privacy"></a><h1 class="h1">Your Privacy</h1>
          <p><i>Put it on its own page? App refers to optilisten.com/privacy (but we could change that), which could be its own page or could redirect to this section of this page.)</i></p>
  
<p>Your privacy is important to us. It is Long Sky Media's policy to respect your privacy and comply with any applicable law and regulation regarding any personal information we may collect about you, including via our application, OptiListen, and its associated services.</p>
<p>Personal information is any information about you which can be used to identify you. This includes information about you as a person (such as name, address, and date of birth), your devices, payment details, and even information about how you use an app or online service.</p>
<p>In the event our app contains links to third-party sites and services, please be aware that those sites and services have their own privacy policies. After following a link to any third-party content, you should read their posted privacy policy information about how they collect and use personal information. This Privacy Policy does not apply to any of your activities after you leave our app.</p>
<p>This policy is effective as of 4 July 2022.</p>
<p>Last updated: 4 July 2022</p>

  <h2>We Collect No Personal Information</h2>
<p>We collect no information from you. We collect no information in either of these two categories: “voluntarily provided” information and “automatically collected” information.</p>
<p>“Voluntarily provided” information refers to any information you knowingly and actively provide us when using our app and its associated services.</p>
<p>“Automatically collected” information refers to any information automatically sent by your device in the course of accessing our app and its associated services.</p>

  <h2>Children’s Privacy</h2>
<p>We do not aim any of our products or services directly at children under the age of 13, and we do not collect personal information about children under 13. (We do not collect personal information at all.)</p>
  <h2>Your Rights and Controlling Your Personal Information</h2>
<p>The app does not collect your personal information, and thus also does not hold, use, or disclose personal information. You do not provide personal information to us, and we receive no personal information about you from any third party.</p>
<p>By law, may request details of the personal information that we hold about you. Because we do not hold any personal information about you, in such a case we will have no such details to share.</p>
  <p><b>Non-discrimination:</b> We will not discriminate against you for exercising any of your rights over your personal information. We will not deny you goods or services and/or charge you different prices or rates for goods or services, including through granting discounts or other benefits, or imposing penalties, or provide you with a different level or quality of goods or services.</p>
  <p><b>Notification of data breaches:</b> We will comply with laws applicable to us in respect of any data breach.</p>
  <p><b>Complaints:</b> If you believe that we have breached a relevant data protection law and wish to make a complaint, please contact us using the details below and provide us with full details of the alleged breach. We will promptly investigate your complaint and respond to you, in writing, setting out the outcome of our investigation and the steps we will take to deal with your complaint. You also have the right to contact a regulatory body or data protection authority in relation to your complaint.</p>
  <p><b>Unsubscribe:</b> We do not gather email address information at this time and thus will not store your email in a database or send communication, marketing communications or otherwise, to any email address.</p>
<p>In the event that future versions of this app offer a method for receiving email updates, we will provide an unsubscribe link at the end of all such email messages.</p>
  <h2>Business Transfers</h2>
<p>If we or our assets are acquired, or in the unlikely event that we go out of business or enter bankruptcy, any data among the assets would not include your personal information. You acknowledge that such transfers may occur, and that any parties who acquire us may, to the extent permitted by applicable law, continue to use acquired data according to this policy, which they will be required to assume as it is the basis for any ownership or use rights we have over such information.</p>
  <h2>Limits of Our Policy</h2>
<p>Our app may link to external sites that are not operated by us. Please be aware that we have no control over the content and policies of those sites, and cannot accept responsibility or liability for their respective privacy practices.</p>
  <h2>Changes to This Policy</2>
<p>At our discretion, we may change our privacy policy to reflect updates to our business processes, current acceptable practices, or legislative or regulatory changes. If we decide to change this privacy policy, we will post the changes here and on our website.</p>
<p>If required by law, we will get your permission or give you the opportunity to opt in to or opt out of, as applicable, any uses of your personal information.</p>
  <h2>Additional Disclosures for General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) Compliance (EU)</h2>
  <h3>Data Controller / Data Processor</h3>
<p>The GDPR distinguishes between organizations that process personal information for their own purposes (known as “data controllers”) and organizations that process personal information on behalf of other organizations (known as “data processors”). We, Long Sky Media, located at the address provided in our Contact Us section, are a Data Controller with respect to any personal information you might provide to us, if it were possible to do so.</p>
  <h3>Legal Bases for Processing Your Personal Information</h3>
<p>We do not collect or use your personal information at all, but if we are ever in the future to collect and use personal information, we will do so only when we have a legal right to do so. In which case, we will collect and use personal information lawfully, fairly, and in a transparent manner. If we are ever to seek your consent to process your personal information, and you are at that time under 16 years of age, we will seek your parent or legal guardian’s consent to process your personal information for that specific purpose.</p>
  <h3>Your Rights and Controlling Your Personal Information</h3>
  <p><b>Restrict:</b> While we do not gather any personal information, it is still your right to request that we restrict the processing of your personal information if (i) you are concerned about the accuracy of your personal information; (ii) you believe your personal information has been unlawfully processed.</p>
  <p><b>Data portability:</b> You may have the right to request a copy of any personal information we hold about you. While we do not at this time gather or hold any such personal information, if we were to do so in the future, then upon request we will provide this information in CSV format or other easily readable machine format. You may also have the right to request that we transfer any such personal information to a third party.</p>
  <p><b>Deletion:</b> You may have a right to request that we delete any personal information we hold about you at any time, and we will take reasonable steps to delete your personal information from our current records. If you ask us to delete your personal information, we will let you know how the deletion affects your use of our app, website or products and services. There may be exceptions to this right for specific legal reasons which, if applicable, we will set out for you in response to your request. If you terminate or delete your account, we will delete your personal information within 90 days of the deletion of your account. Please be aware that search engines and similar third parties may still retain copies of your personal information that has been made public at least once, like certain profile information and public comments, even after you have deleted the information from our services or deactivated your account.</p>
  <h2>Additional Disclosures for California Compliance (US)</h2>
<p>Under California Civil Code Section 1798.83, if you live in California and your business relationship with us is mainly for personal, family, or household purposes, you may ask us about the information we release to other organizations for their marketing purposes (which is, at this time, none at all).</p>
<p>To make such a request, please contact us using the details provided in this privacy policy with “Request for California privacy information” in the subject line. You may make this type of request once every calendar year. We will email you a list of categories of personal information we revealed to other organizations for their marketing purposes in the last calendar year, along with their names and addresses. Not all personal information shared in this way is covered by Section 1798.83 of the California Civil Code.</p>
  <h3>California Notice of Collection</h3>
<p>For more information on information we collect, including the sources we receive information from, review the “We Collect No Personal Information” section.</p>
  <h3>Right to Know and Delete</h3>
<p>If you are a California resident, you have rights to delete any personal information we collected and know certain information about our data practices in the preceding 12 months. In particular, you have the right to request the following from us:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The categories of personal information we have collected about you;</li>
  <li>The categories of sources from which the personal information was collected;</li>
  <li>The categories of personal information about you we disclosed for a business purpose or sold;</li>
  <li>The categories of third parties to whom the personal information was disclosed for a business purpose or sold;</li>
  <li>The business or commercial purpose for collecting or selling the personal information; and</li>
  <li>The specific pieces of personal information we have collected about you.</li>
</ul>
  
<p>To exercise any of these rights, please contact us using the details provided in this privacy policy.</p>

  <h3>Shine the Light</h3>
<p>If you are a California resident, in addition to the rights discussed above, you have the right to request information from us regarding the manner (if at all) in which we share certain personal information as defined by California’s “Shine the Light” with third parties and affiliates for their own direct marketing purposes.</p>
<p>To receive this information, send us a request using the contact details provided in this privacy policy. Requests must include “California Privacy Rights Request” in the first line of the description and include your name, street address, city, state, and ZIP code.</p>
